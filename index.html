            <h3>Summary</h3>
          <div class="col-sm">
          <p>Recifit is a conceptual mobile application that integrates fitness goals and healthy diets by highlighting personalization on nutritional needs. Per our research, it is currently rare to find a digitalized dietary assistance service that takes a user’s BMI, nutritional needs, and taste preferences into consideration through the recommendation of recipes. With this idea in mind, we as a group of three UX design students wish to create a prototype for this concept that potentially helps accommodate the user’s fitness goals and lifestyle.
          </p>

            <h3>Objective</h3>
          <div class="col-sm">
            <p>The objective of this project was to design the interface of a mobile App that curates and recommends recipes by learning the users’ fitness goals and dietary preferences and constraints.</p>

            <p>Almongst our 17 survey participants, more than half of them consider themselves avid cooks. This finding reassured that there could potentially be a market for a recipe recommendation App. We also discovered a surprising insight through our one-on-one interviews: the lack of variety in diet plans may incur a negative mental impact. We learned that when most people diet, there is a common pain point of having to compromise tatste for health and nutritional benefits. </p>

          <p class="lead" id="problem-statement-copy">We found out through our survey that over half of our participants find it fairly difficult to stick to a diet. And that over 80% of participants value taste more than nutritional benefits. Finding the right diet and sticking to it is tough, especially without any guidance from a professional dietitian. Without prior knowledge on healthy eating, people may find it difficult to achieve their fitness goals or to reach their ideal weight. Moreover, the lack of variety in diets can potentially incur a negative mental impact. </p>

            <p> Usability testing results indicated that the commenting function in the social section and the favorite function in the recipe section still need more iteration to be intuitive. The onboarding process could be simplified to prevent new users from dropping out prematurely. Top feedback we received included the need for a progress bar throughout the onboarding process, and adding a button with a plus sign on the recipe cards to visually indicate a "save for future use" concept. </p>

      <p>Recifit, a meal planning mobile App that doubles as a recipe hub, guides, inspires, and engages users to reach their weight goals by providing a sweet balance between flavor and nutrition. Serving as a digital nutritionist, Recifit considers users' personal health and fitness data when generating recipe recommendations, allowing users to build and sustain healthy dietary habits without having to compromise taste.</p>

      <h2 id="conclusion-and-future-opportunities">Conclusion and Future Opportunities</h2>
      <p>After usability testing, we reconsidered the level of necessity for some previously planned functions, which helped us narrow down the scope of what we are trying to build. After consideration, we decided to eliminate the friends and community feature on our App because of time constraints of this project, but the idea is reserved as a future opportunity. Per the valuable feedback from the usability testing phase, we re-designed the preferences setting in the onboarding questionnaire into a list of toggle buttons hidden in a hamburger menu, to still keep the function in a much tidier and streamlined way. </p>
